# Meowvie

Just some random project that attempt to ease and simplify getting movie or anime download urls.

## Tech Stacks
* Golang as Backend
  > I choose golang beacuse I need good performance, and good search engine library (prevent use elasticsearch or equivalent) 
* Nodejs as Crawler
  > Because my Python skill is poor, so I dont think any other than Nodejs has good ecosystem for web scraping.
* Deno as Frontend
  > It just ease to develop, ease to deploy

## Performance
No benchmark was done, but I was tested it with 30 concurrent queries on 256 MB ram, and so far so good, the slowest is response time is arround `500ms`
